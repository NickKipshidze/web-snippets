# fast-api-chat

This is a simple FastAPI chat app.

Written in couple hours, so code is far from perfect.

`frontend-pyqt5` is experimental and looks like a mess but it works.

Currently working on fixing client side comment updating.

Start the `uvicorn` server with:
```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload
```
